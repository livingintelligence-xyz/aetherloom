# 05 — Execution & Orchestration

Execution is where the engine finally touches the world, so it carries the heaviest engineering: content staging, precondition verification, post-write verification, a crash-safe journal, and per-item base-record updates. The orchestrator composes the whole pipeline and is the app's single entry point.

## 1. `SyncOrchestrator`

```swift
public actor SyncOrchestrator {
    public init(
        locations: LocationDirectory,                  // LocationID → SyncLocation
        providers: [LocationID: any StorageProvider],
        stores: EngineStores,                          // base records, journal, conflicts, activity, advice cache [09]
        stage: ContentStage,
        advisor: (any ConflictAdvisor)? = nil,         // [07]
        environment: EngineEnvironment                 // clock, ID gen, timeouts, parallelism caps
    )

    /// Stages 1–5. Read-only against providers. Always safe.
    public func prepare(_ syncSet: SyncSet) async -> SyncPreparation

    /// Explicit one-shot review: issue an in-memory authorization, run a fresh
    /// full prepare, and atomically exchange it for an execution reservation
    /// only when the original unreviewed fingerprint/evidence match exactly.
    public func prepareReviewedMassDeletion(from original: SyncPreparation) async -> SyncPreparation

    /// Stage 6–7. Runs only a clear-gated plan, or an approvable held plan
    /// with a valid approval. Reviewed mass deletion additionally consumes its
    /// actor-owned live reservation before executor construction.
    public func execute(_ preparation: SyncPreparation, approval: PlanApproval? = nil) async throws -> SyncRunSummary
}

public struct SyncPreparation: Sendable {
    public var outcome: PlanOutcome            // refusal | plan
    public var preview: ChangePreview          // rendered for both cases [06]
    public var advice: [ConflictAdvice]        // possibly empty
    public var runID: UUID
    public var preparationID: UUID             // ephemeral identity; excluded from fingerprints
    public var executionAuthorityExpiresAt: Date? // display ceiling only; never bearer authority
}

/// Internal actor state only: deliberately not public and not Codable.
internal struct MassDeletionExecutionReservation: Sendable {
    let nonce: UUID
    let reviewedFingerprint: PlanFingerprint
    let runID: UUID
    let preparationID: UUID
    let expiresAt: Date
}
```

Prepare/execute is a hard split: the UI holds a `SyncPreparation`, shows the preview, and collects a bridge-owned `WorkspaceExecutionConfirmation` only when its gate is executable. Nothing is recomputed between what the user saw and what runs, and reality is *still* re-verified per operation. An ordinary non-approvable hold never reaches this core execute entry point through the production bridge.

`prepareReviewedMassDeletion(from:)` is a second provider-read-only preparation path, not execution and not gate mutation. It accepts only the exact ordinary `massDeletion` preparation displayed to the user; issues the opaque in-memory authorization described in [04 §4](04-planning-and-gating.md#one-shot-review-for-intentional-deletions); records issuance; performs the entire stage 1–5 path again; and on an exact match atomically consumes that authorization while installing an opaque actor-owned execution reservation bound to the reviewed fingerprint, `runID`, and `preparationID`. Only after the transition and its audit record are durable may it expose `reviewedMassDeletion`. Expiry or mismatch consumes/rejects the authorization and returns the fresh ordinary outcome with no reservation and no provider mutation. The bearer authorization, bearer reservation, and reviewed preparation are never restored as authority after relaunch. `executionAuthorityExpiresAt` lets presentation cap its countdown to the reservation's expiry; it is descriptive metadata, not authority.

**Stage checklist** (each bracketed by activity entries with the shared `runID`, [08](08-observability.md)):

1. **Recover** — if the journal has an unfinished run for this set, run recovery (§4) first.
2. **Availability** — `checkAvailability()` concurrently; any unavailable ⇒ `refusal`, and *no scans run* (a partial view must never coexist with mutation decisions).
3. **Scan** — concurrent `scan(_:)` with per-location timeout (default 120 s; a hang becomes `unavailable`).
4. **Reconcile + plan + gate** — load the existing mass-deletion latch, call pure reconciliation/planning/gating with it as an injected value, then durably apply the returned latch transition before exposing any preparation ([03], [04]). Planner/gate code performs no store I/O.
5. **Preview + advice** — only after latch persistence succeeds, render preview; if held and an advisor exists, request advice under budget ([07 §5]); persist `ConflictDecision`s.
6. **Execute** — §3.
7. **Summarize** — `SyncRunSummary { outcome: completed | refused | held | stoppedForReplan(location, path) | mutationIndeterminate(location, path, receiptID) | cancelled | failed(message), appliedOperations, skippedOperations, failedOperations, indeterminateOperations, perItemResults }`. Older persisted summaries decode a missing `indeterminateOperations` field as an empty list.

Overlap guard: one in-flight run per sync set; a second call fails fast with a typed error. Cancellation is cooperative between operations, never mid-commit; cancelled runs report truthfully and the next prepare starts from a fresh scan.

## 2. `ContentStage` — content-addressed staging

```swift
public actor ContentStage {
    public init(rootDirectory: URL, byteLimit: Int64)   // root injected; default cache dir chosen by the APP, not core
    public func materialize(_ ref: ContentRef, from provider: any StorageProvider) async throws -> StagedContent
    public func release(_ content: StagedContent) async
}
public struct StagedContent: Sendable { public var url: URL; public var verifiedHash: String?; public var size: Int64 }
```

- **Download once, fan out many.** A 3-destination create performs 1 fetch + 3 stores. (Today's executor re-downloads per action.)
- **Integrity:** after fetch, hash the staged bytes; if the source advertised a hash and it mismatches ⇒ fail the item (`error` activity), never propagate corrupt content. If the source has no hash, record size and pass the engine-computed hash forward — destinations and base records get it, upgrading future comparisons.
- **One canonical owner.** Handles for the same canonical stage root share one process-wide storage actor, so orchestrator reconstruction cannot clean a live temporary write or lose a receipt-bound pin.
- Eviction: LRU by bytes; contents referenced by an in-flight run are pinned. Crash leftovers are garbage-collected on next start by the app-side owner.

## 3. `ScheduleExecutor`

For local-folder schedules, execution first performs the normative [all-location arbitrary-folder classification preflight](../providers/local/01-package-and-metadata-safety.md#5-all-location-preflight-adjacent-checks-and-recovery). After preview and confirmation, under live access and before the schedule's first provider mutation, it classifies every affected item/subtree at every participating location. Any exclusion, unavailability, or ambiguous probe aborts the whole schedule with zero provider mutations and requires a fresh prepare. Per-operation mutation-adjacent classification checks remain defense in depth.

Executes an `OperationSchedule` wave by wave (topological order over `dependsOn`), honoring the global transfer-before-trash barrier ([04 §3]). Within a wave, operations on *different locations* may run concurrently (bounded, default 3); per-location execution is serial. Per operation:

```text
journal.intent(op)                                   // §4 — BEFORE any side effect
probe   = provider.currentState / absence check      // evaluate op.precondition against reality
mismatch ⇒ throw stoppedForReplan(location, path)    // aborts the remainder of the run — never retried internally
already-satisfied ⇒ journal.result(op, .skipped)     // idempotent re-runs come from here
apply   (makeFolder / transfer via stage / relocate / trash)
deadline before provider start ⇒ result(.deadlineExpiredBeforeStart)
deadline after provider start ⇒ mutationIndeterminate(op, receipt); stop
verify  = re-read metadata; size (+hash where available) must match what we wrote
journal.result(op, .applied(newObservation) | .failed(error))
```

Post-write verification is new and cheap insurance: it catches truncated uploads and provider-side rewrites at the only moment the engine knows exactly what the destination should look like, and it captures the destination's fresh revision token for the base record.

## 4. `RunJournal` — crash safety

Append-only write-ahead log per run (`journal-<runID>.jsonl`, [09 §3]): `runStarted(planFingerprint)`, `intent(op)`, `mutationIndeterminate(op, receipt)`, `result(op, outcome)`, `itemConverged(decisionID, BaseRecord)`, `runFinished(outcome)`.

- **Base records update per item**, emitted as `itemConverged` the moment all of an item's operations report `applied`/`skipped` — not as a bulk write at run end. The record store consumes the journal stream; a crash can lose at most the in-flight item's update, never leave half a run's records pretending convergence.
- A post-start deadline appends `mutationIndeterminate` but **not** a terminal `result`, `runFinished`, or “Sync finished” activity. The provider retains the late task and blocks normal provider work; the journal retains the same receipt across process restart. Operations already queued behind that mutation are resolved as pre-start/no-side-effect and never resume from the old schedule.
- If the `mutationIndeterminate` append itself fails after the side effect started, execution fails closed with only the intent durable. Same-process recovery discovers only a retained receipt bound to that exact run and operation, appends the missing event, and only then claims recovery. Another append failure leaves both the intent and provider barrier intact.
- **Recovery** (stage 1): a journal with `runStarted` but no `runFinished` ⇒ for each `intent` without a `result`, first wait for any in-process owned work to reach quiescence, then atomically claim the exact receipt and probe actual provider state. The exclusive claim spans every probe and `markReconciled`; a probe or journal failure restores the barrier for retry. After restart, only provider truth can resolve the claim. Provider unavailability never becomes confirmed absence. Local recovery applies the same all-location package/metadata/permissions/ACL/ownership classification before accepting convergence or releasing barriers. Local relocate recovery always probes both endpoints and accepts convergence only when the exact-kind destination has same-version evidence for the intended item and the source is positively absent or matching recoverable trash. Any exclusion or ambiguous classification, both-present state, mismatched/unknown destination evidence, uncertain trash, or unavailable endpoint leaves the WAL and barrier unresolved. Recovery never reissues the move. Receipt-bound staging temporary files and source pins are released only after the journal is durably reconciled.
- Recovery **never resumes or reapplies the old schedule**. It establishes truth, durably marks the journal reconciled, releases provider barriers, and only then allows availability checks, fresh scans, and replanning. This keeps "what runs" derived from "what is" and prevents duplicate mutation.

## 5. Execution gate enforcement

Core `execute` has a single choke point: `gate == .clear` runs; `gate == .hold && gate.permitsApproval` requires `approval.validate(against: plan, at: now) == .accepted` (fingerprint match, unexpired, acknowledged counts equal actual — [06 §3]); any other hold returns `.held` without an executor call; refusals are unexecutable by type. Ordinary `massDeletion` never permits approval. For `reviewedMassDeletion`, a valid approval is necessary but insufficient: immediately before constructing `ScheduleExecutor`, the orchestrator atomically looks up and consumes its actor-owned live `MassDeletionExecutionReservation`, matching the exact reviewed fingerprint, `runID`, and `preparationID`. Missing, expired, already-consumed, relaunch-lost, or mismatched reservation state returns `.held` or a typed rejection with zero executor construction and zero executor/provider calls. Consumption remains one-shot even if later construction or execution fails; the durable latch remains until the successful reconciliation condition below. The Codable reviewed hold, its audit digests, and a valid confirmation cannot recreate or replace the reservation.

In the production seam, every otherwise executable preparation first requires a valid non-optional `WorkspaceExecutionConfirmation`: the bridge derives `PlanApproval` for an approvable hold, and passes `nil` for a clear plan only after validating that confirmation itself. For a reviewed plan, `expiresAt` MUST NOT exceed `executionAuthorityExpiresAt`; core independently checks the reservation clock at consumption. Confirmation and reservation consumption are logged as `safety` activity/journal events without bearer values. Per-operation preconditions apply identically with or without the internal approval value — authority never bypasses current-reality checks.

The executor clears a matching `MassDeletionSafetyLatch` only after every deletion decision in the reviewed plan is applied or safely already satisfied, the corresponding base-record/tombstone updates and `runFinished(.completed)` are durable, and the journal is reconciled. Partial success, replan stops, indeterminate mutation, journal/store failure, cancellation, or failed post-write verification leaves the latch intact.

## 6. Changing the current code

Phases 5–7 of [11-migration.md](11-migration.md). Today's `SyncPlanExecutor` ✅ already has the two hardest habits right — per-action precondition probes (`destinationChangedRequiresReplan`) and skip-if-satisfied idempotency — and its tests transfer directly to the `ScheduleExecutor`. New: staging (replaces per-action temp-file download), post-write verification, journal, wave ordering (replaces implicit action order), per-item record updates, and the orchestrator itself (today nothing composes the pipeline; tests do it by hand). The old executor is deleted after its test suite passes against the new one via the Phase-4 adapter.
