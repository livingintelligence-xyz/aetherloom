# 10 — Testing Strategy

The architecture was shaped to be provable: pure reconciliation makes the decision table exhaustively checkable, decision-shaped plans make previews property-testable, fakes with call logs make read-only phases assertable, and the journal makes crash recovery a replayable unit test. Swift Testing throughout; zero network; zero real user folders; injected clocks and seeded randomness; the current 20 green tests are the behavioral contract every migration phase must keep passing ([11 §1]).

## 1. The test pyramid

```text
        Simulation suite          random multi-run scenarios on fakes; invariants asserted (§4)
      Orchestrator/executor       stage-by-stage behavior, journal recovery, gates, ordering
    Decision-table exhaustion     reconcile() — every row, plus generated fact-product sweep
  Pure unit tests                 versions, paths, naming, fingerprints, validators, catalogs
```

## 2. Decision-table exhaustion (the centerpiece)

- One named test per row of [03 §3] — the row number appears in the test name (`row10_editDelete_preservesEditAndRepropagates`).
- A generated sweep: for 2–4 locations, enumerate the full product of `LocationFact` shapes per item (bounded vocabulary ⇒ enumerable), assert `reconcile` is total (never traps), and assert the four meta-properties on every output: **no `propagateDeletion` without a base record and all-present-sides-matching**, **no content overwrite when any pairwise comparison is `unknown`**, **placeholders never influence deletion rows**, and **every base record covered by an item/subtree exclusion derives waiting/excluded at every location with zero deletion decisions**. Exclusion ancestry fixtures include normalized Unicode, case-only paths on an insensitive volume, and component-boundary non-ancestors.
- Move-matching and subtree-folding passes ([03 §5]) tested as pure transformations with hash-absent fallbacks.

## 3. Layer contracts

| Layer | Key tests |
| --- | --- |
| Domain | `VersionComparison` matrix incl. unknown-never-equals; `SyncPath` normalization/Unicode/case-fold; conflict naming (extensions, collisions, determinism) ✅ |
| Providers/fakes | Contract suite run against `FakeStorageProvider` (and later every real provider, opt-in): failure-never-emptiness, `.complete` accounts for every path as observation or typed exclusion with none unaccounted, placeholder inclusion, precondition-enforcing stores, quarantine exclusion; deterministic mutation/read gates distinguish pre-start expiry, post-start late success/failure, retained read timeout/cancellation, writer-preferred admission, same-root reconstruction (including a broken/restored configured symlink), unknown-alias rejection, wrong-receipt rejection, and reconciliation release |
| Planning/gating | Refusal reasons for every unavailability/incomplete variant incl. disconnected local volume and unreachable NAS; threshold intent-counting (same user act ⇒ same gating across 2 vs 4 locations); exact clamp/decode/update matrix (`1...25`/`0.01...0.25` delete, `1...50`/`0.01...0.50` edit) proving no settings path exceeds the default maxima; pure gate receives an injected latch and returns a transition with no store I/O; orchestrator applies that transition before exposing preparation; latch survives relaunch and any allowed in-range increase, clears only on changed evidence or successful reconciled reviewed execution, and fails closed when corrupt; fingerprint test injects different generated decision/operation/run/preparation IDs, `generatedAt`/`scannedAt`, and enumeration orders over identical semantic inputs and gets the same unreviewed fingerprint, while each semantic drift changes it; one-shot review issue/expiry/consume/mismatch matrix; original/reviewed fingerprint distinction; schedule validator invariants (§ [04 §3] 1–4) |
| Preview/approval | Decision-partition property; trash causality strings; golden previews; confirmation/gate matrix (clear/no-count; clear/nonzero-trash requiring acknowledgement; approvable hold with exact acknowledgements; ordinary non-approvable `massDeletion`; mixed hold containing ordinary `massDeletion`; exact-match reviewed-mass-deletion plan requiring exact counts and its live reservation; wrong/expired/reused review authorization; changed settings/world/evidence; wrong fingerprint / expired confirmation / wrong counts; reviewed value with missing/expired/reused/relaunch-lost/wrong-run/wrong-preparation/wrong-fingerprint reservation; confirmed-but-drifted still aborts); every reservation failure asserts zero executor construction and zero executor/provider calls |
| Executor | Precondition abort ✅; idempotent re-run ✅; stage fan-out (1 fetch, n stores — call-log asserted); hash-mismatch quarantine; post-write verification failure path; transfer-before-trash barrier; per-location concurrency bound |
| Journal/recovery | Kill the run (scripted fault) after each journal event type; persist review issuance, authorization-to-reservation transition/rejection, reservation consumption/expiry/rejection, and latch lifecycle as digests/audit only; persist neither bearer; audit-append failure blocks reviewed-plan exposure or executor construction as applicable; persist indeterminate receipts; repair a failed indeterminate append from the retained provider receipt before probing; recovery establishes truth without resuming or duplicating a mutation; relocate recovery covers destination-only/source-absent, recoverably trashed source, both-present copy-before-trash, wrong kind/version, unavailable endpoints, and insufficient evidence; stale queued calls stay pre-start while a fresh post-recovery call succeeds; unavailable truth keeps the journal unfinished; receipt-tied stage pins/temporary files are reclaimed; at-most-one-item record loss; `runFinished` idempotence |
| Orchestrator | Prepare is provider-read-only; fake call logs show zero provider mutations, while latch-store spies prove load → pure gate → durable transition before preparation exposure; unavailable location short-circuits before scan; scan timeout ⇒ refusal; overlap guard; reviewed execution atomically consumes the matching actor-owned reservation before executor construction and every missing/expired/reused/relaunch-restored/mismatched case makes zero executor calls; same-root reconstructed orchestrator stops in recovery behind the original live owner and replans only after durable release; tombstone re-appearance ⇒ new file; activity checklist [08 §3] complete for a mixed run |
| Advisory | Nil-advisor byte-identity; malformed/slow/unavailable handling; heuristic rules exact; cache prevents re-inference; excerpts never populated |
| Stores | Round-trips, including a fractional receipt timestamp reloaded from the file journal and matched by stable mutation identity; corrupt file ⇒ typed error ⇒ deletion-refusal end-to-end; torn JSONL lines; prune retention; registry refusal while referenced |

## 4. Simulation suite (the confidence multiplier)

A model-based random tester, seeded and replayable (`Support/SeededRandom`):

1. Build a sync set over 2–4 fake locations with random initial trees.
2. Loop N rounds: apply a random batch of user-like mutations at random locations (create/edit/rename/move/delete/case-rename; occasionally toggle a location unavailable, inject an incomplete scan, sprinkle placeholders, kill a run mid-execution via `FlakyStorageProvider`).
3. After each round, run prepare/execute (auto-approving holds after asserting their evidence) until fixed point.
4. Assert global invariants continuously:
   - **Preservation:** the multiset of distinct content hashes across all locations *plus fake trash* never shrinks.
   - **Convergence:** healthy rounds reach fixed point in ≤ 2 runs; the fixed point has identical trees (modulo conflict copies) everywhere.
   - **No false deletion:** any content absent at the end was trashed by an explicit `propagateDeletion` decision traceable in the journal.
   - **Refusal dominance:** rounds containing unavailability/incompleteness produce refusals and zero mutations at any provider.
- 500+ seeded iterations in CI-tier runs; a failing seed is committed as a named regression test.

## 5. Wording lock & performance smoke

- Golden tests over `ActivityMessageCatalog` and refusal/hold notices: every canonical sentence byte-exact, so safety-language edits are deliberate diffs.
- `@Test(.timeLimit)`: 10 000 items × 3 locations reconciles + plans in < 5 s debug — catches accidental quadratic grouping (the `ObservationIndex` exists precisely to keep this linear).

## 6. Real-provider tests (later, for completeness)

Opt-in only (env-flagged), temp directories and scripted fake mounts only, never a user's real cloud root or share; the provider contract suite of §3 is the acceptance bar for every real integration. On-device model tests likewise opt-in ([07 §6]).
