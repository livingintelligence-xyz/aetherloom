# 01 — Package and macOS Metadata Safety (Local MVP)

This is the normative local-provider fidelity boundary for the Local Workspace MVP. It resolves the package, extended-attribute, Finder metadata, and resource-fork questions left open in [00-overview.md](00-overview.md). The MVP synchronizes ordinary file data and directory structure. It does **not** claim round-trip fidelity for unsupported macOS metadata.

## 1. Positive scan exclusions

A complete local scan MUST report unsupported content as typed positive evidence, not omit it. `LocationSnapshot` therefore needs an exclusion collection equivalent to:

```swift
public struct ScanExclusion: Codable, Hashable, Sendable {
    public var path: SyncPath
    public var scope: Scope              // item | subtree
    public var reason: Reason

    public enum Scope: Codable, Hashable, Sendable { case item, subtree }
    public enum Reason: Codable, Hashable, Sendable {
        case packageDirectory
        case unsupportedMetadata(Set<MetadataKind>)
        case unsupportedPOSIXPermissions(actual: UInt16, required: UInt16)
        case accessControlList
        case unsupportedOwnership
    }
}

public enum MetadataKind: Codable, Hashable, Sendable {
    case extendedAttributes
    case finderTags
    case finderInfo
    case resourceFork
}
```

Names may change during implementation, but the semantics may not. An exclusion proves **present but unsupported** at a path. It is neither absence nor an ordinary observation. A complete scan accounts for every in-scope path as an observation or as covered by one of these item/subtree exclusions; no path may remain unaccounted. Duplicate reasons SHOULD be normalized into one stable exclusion per root path.

Planner/reconciler treatment is exclusion/waiting, not deletion: the path or subtree MUST NOT be transferred, base-recorded, overwritten, relocated, trashed, or described as converged. Every existing `BaseRecord` whose path equals an item exclusion, equals a subtree exclusion root, or lies below a subtree exclusion root retains its prior memory and derives visible waiting/excluded at **every** location. No covered root or descendant may derive absence, `missing`, or a deletion decision, even though the provider correctly emitted no descendant observations. Coverage MUST use the same component-aware normalized and case/diacritic-folded `SyncPath` ancestry relation as reconciliation joins, never a raw string prefix.

An exclusion at any location blocks mutations for the affected path or subtree at **all** locations. This prevents a supported-looking copy elsewhere from overwriting, deleting, or falsely converging content whose full truth is unsupported on one side. An approval cannot override an exclusion. A future scan that positively proves the exclusion is gone may return the scope to ordinary reconciliation; prior base memory is then evaluated against fresh truth.

Every exclusion root MUST be durably recorded and remain individually inspectable in preview and activity with its exact sync-relative path, scope, and stable human-readable reason. Display grouping is aggregation only: it MUST NOT discard or merge away root evidence. One directory exclusion represents its whole subtree and MUST NOT fabricate descendant absence, descendant observations, or thousands of synthetic per-descendant rows. A run containing exclusions MUST NOT use an all-synced/success presentation for the affected scope.

## 2. macOS package directories

The provider MUST request and inspect [`URLResourceKey.isPackageKey`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlresourcekey/ispackagekey) for the selected root and every enumerated directory. During enrollment, while live security-scoped access is held, the session MUST canonicalize the selected root and walk that canonical root plus each ancestor **only through the volume root**. It rejects the selection if the selected root or any walked ancestor is a package. Failure to read reliable package metadata for any walked path fails closed before enrollment; the walk never crosses the selected volume root.

- A selected package root, or a directory selected anywhere inside a package, is rejected during enrollment. No location or sync set is created.
- An encountered package is emitted as `.packageDirectory` with subtree scope.
- The enumerator MUST NOT descend into it.
- The provider, planner, and executor MUST NOT transfer, base-record, overwrite, relocate, or trash the package or any descendant in the MVP.
- A previously tracked ordinary directory that becomes a package is exclusion/waiting, never missing or deleted.

Package extensions or filename heuristics are insufficient. If the package resource value cannot be read reliably, the scan is incomplete or unavailable; it is not permission to descend.

## 3. Unsupported metadata and resource forks

Ordinary file data bytes and directory structure are supported. Before emitting an ordinary observation, the provider MUST inspect enough filesystem metadata to detect:

- every raw extended-attribute name and whether the one bounded exception below applies;
- Finder tags;
- nonempty FinderInfo;
- a nonempty resource fork; and
- inability to determine whether any of the above is present.

Every extended attribute remains unsupported and produces the existing typed exclusion except for this single compatibility exception: the provider MUST ignore only the exact, case-sensitive raw name `com.apple.provenance`, and only when the running OS reports

```c
xattr_preserve_for_intent("com.apple.provenance", XATTR_OPERATION_INTENT_SYNC) == 0
```

for that name. The native C predicate is a total integer classification: exact `0` means do not preserve and every nonzero value means preserve. A typed adapter MUST map those results to `.ignored` and `.preserve`, respectively. Binding/API unavailability and failure to invoke the native call are distinct typed adapter outcomes and fail closed. The adapter MUST also model an injected `.ambiguous` outcome that is reachable only at the test seam to prove fail-closed consumers; it is not a native C return value. Matching is exact: no prefix, suffix, case folding, Unicode normalization, canonicalized-name comparison, or other equivalence is permitted. Near names such as `Com.apple.provenance`, `com.apple.provenance.*`, and suffix-encoded variants remain unsupported. Adapter `.preserve`, `.unavailable`, `.callFailed`, or test-only `.ambiguous` produces the existing unsupported-extended-attribute item/subtree exclusion. Any other xattr on the same item also retains that exclusion. Finder tags, FinderInfo, resource forks, quarantine metadata, and all other security or user metadata retain their existing rules.

The value of the ignored exact attribute is opaque. Aetherloom accepts no payload schema, length, version, or semantic interpretation because Apple publishes none for this attribute. The provider MUST NOT interpret, compare, normalize, log, fingerprint, or expose its payload bytes, and MUST NOT use its presence, absence, or value as content, version, mutation, convergence, or recovery authority. Presence, absence, appearance, disappearance, or value changes of this ignored attribute alone do not change item truth, create an operation, exclude a file, or make a directory opaque. A directory carrying only this ignored attribute is observed normally and descended into. A provider-created destination may have or acquire it and still converge when all synchronized truth matches.

Aetherloom MUST never explicitly set, copy, or delete `com.apple.provenance`, and MUST never request metadata-copy behavior for it. Every cross-location content transfer and every staging or materialization copy MUST copy the regular file's data fork only. This includes source-to-stage fetch, stage-cache materialization, destination temporary-file creation, content replacement, cross-filesystem or cross-location relocate fallbacks, and any copy used during interruption recovery. Directory creation copies structure only and applies no source metadata. Source provenance therefore cannot propagate as copied metadata through an Aetherloom transfer. The invoked copy/materialization API and flags MUST positively prove data-fork-only behavior; a general copy or replacement path that can carry source or staged metadata is not sufficient.

A same-filesystem rename or move of the same filesystem object is different: OS-owned local metadata may remain attached to that object because no new cross-location materialization occurred. That retention is not synchronized metadata and Aetherloom still does not inspect, set, copy, or delete it. At a newly created or replaced destination, provenance is likewise owned by the running OS and filesystem; it may be retained, regenerated, changed, or omitted as a side effect of content replacement. Aetherloom neither promises nor forces any outcome, and MUST NOT blindly copy old destination provenance onto new content because no authoritative semantics prove that safe. This boundary avoids transferring source trust/origin state while leaving destination-local policy to the OS.

Finder tags and FinderInfo are called out explicitly even when represented through extended attributes so preview/activity can name the reason users recognize. A file with any unsupported metadata is an item-scoped `.unsupportedMetadata` exclusion. A directory with any unsupported metadata is a subtree-scoped exclusion and MUST NOT be descended into, because propagating descendants while omitting container semantics would misrepresent the tree.

If xattr-name enumeration or resource-fork probing fails, the scan is incomplete; the provider MUST NOT silently emit an ordinary observation. Adapter `.unavailable`, `.callFailed`, or injected test-seam `.ambiguous` while classifying exact-name `com.apple.provenance` is instead positive unsupported-xattr classification and uses the existing typed exclusion. Empty resource forks are not exclusions. The selected root's own metadata is container metadata outside synchronized content: it is inspected only as needed for access/package enrollment safety, is not transferred, and does not exclude otherwise supported descendants.

Apple's File Provider contract exposes extended attributes as metadata, says the system determines which attributes synchronize, and treats resource forks as content; see [`NSFileProviderItemProtocol.extendedAttributes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileprovider/nsfileprovideritemprotocol/extendedattributes). Apple's public `copyfile` sources define [`XATTR_OPERATION_INTENT_SYNC` and `XATTR_FLAG_SYNCABLE`](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/copyfile/blob/9f91eb6ced021952278816cdc76ad68da8631ccb/xattr_flags.h), implement the [name-to-flags table and sync-intent predicate](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/copyfile/blob/9f91eb6ced021952278816cdc76ad68da8631ccb/xattr_flags.c), and document [`xattr_name_with_flags(3)`](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/copyfile/blob/9f91eb6ced021952278816cdc76ad68da8631ccb/xattr_name_with_flags.3). Unknown names default to no syncable flag in that published source, whose table does not name `com.apple.provenance`; the live predicate on the running OS nevertheless remains authoritative. Apple publishes the predicate and its default behavior, but no authoritative payload schema or semantics for this attribute. This is therefore a bounded compatibility exception, not a preservation claim or a general xattr allowlist. Aetherloom's current staging path has not proven broader metadata round-trip fidelity, so every attribute outside the exact live-classified exception remains excluded.

## 4. POSIX permissions, ACLs, and ownership

The MVP supports one explicit baseline rather than claiming general Unix metadata fidelity:

- a regular file MUST have exactly `0644` permission bits; and
- a directory MUST have exactly `0755` permission bits.

Any deviation from those exact baselines—including an executable bit on a regular file or any setuid/setgid/sticky bit—is an `.unsupportedPOSIXPermissions` exclusion. Any access control list is an `.accessControlList` exclusion. A file exclusion is item-scoped; a directory exclusion is subtree-scoped and the provider MUST NOT descend into it. Inability to read mode or ACL state makes the scan incomplete rather than supported.

User and group ownership are not synchronized from a source item. The supported baseline is ownership by the process's effective user ID and effective primary group ID at both source and destination. Any other ownership is `.unsupportedOwnership` (item or subtree as above); inability to prove ownership fails closed. Provider-created files and directories MUST be created and post-write verified with the exact `0644`/`0755` mode and baseline ownership. A failure to establish or verify that baseline is a failed/refused operation, never convergence. The selected root's mode, ACL, and ownership remain container metadata outside synchronized content.

This conservative baseline intentionally excludes many otherwise ordinary files: `0664`/`0775` content produced by `umask 002`, regular files carrying any executable bit, directories whose mode is not exactly `0755`, private `0600` files, and foreign-owned content copied from another Mac or restored from backup. A non-baseline directory excludes its entire subtree. That breadth is an accepted MVP consequence; the provider MUST NOT normalize source metadata on read or silently broaden the baseline. General permission/ownership preservation remains outside L2.

L2 qualification MUST measure realistic exclusion volume using disposable representative Documents and Projects trees containing ordinary umask, executable, private, and foreign-owned fixtures. It proves bounded scan/preparation behavior, individually inspectable durable evidence, stable display grouping, and one-row-per-exclusion-root subtree representation without synthetic descendant rows. Reopen this baseline in a separate architecture PR only if that qualification demonstrates that representative intended roots are impractical to enroll or preview, exclusion evidence cannot be inspected within the performance/UI acceptance budget, or a proven safe round-trip/normalization policy can broaden support without weakening ownership, recovery, or no-false-deletion guarantees.

## 5. All-location preflight, adjacent checks, and recovery

After preview and confirmation, but before the operation schedule's **first provider mutation**, execution MUST acquire live folder access and run one fail-closed classification preflight for every affected item or subtree at every participating location. “Affected” includes each operation's source, destination, item that may be displaced, and synchronized ancestors below the selected root. The classification covers packages, extended attributes, the exact-name live sync-intent predicate above, Finder tags/FinderInfo, resource forks, POSIX modes/special bits, ACLs, and ownership.

The entire preflight completes before any mutation is admitted. A new exclusion at any participating location, an unavailable location, or any ambiguous/failed classification aborts the entire schedule with zero mutations at every location and requires a fresh prepare and preview. Confirmation never overrides this result.

Mutation-adjacent provider checks remain mandatory defense in depth after the preflight. Immediately before each physical commit, the provider MUST re-check the applicable classification and ordinary version/absence preconditions. The exact-name adapter is re-evaluated at scan, all-location preflight, mutation-adjacent classification, and recovery; a result that changes to `.preserve`, `.unavailable`, `.callFailed`, or injected test-seam `.ambiguous` stops or refuses through the existing fail-closed path before mutation or convergence. Drift arising after the all-location barrier stops the run; it never authorizes an overwrite or trash. Root container metadata remains outside synchronized content.

Recovery uses the same all-location, live-access classification rule before it accepts convergence, releases receipt-bound artifacts/barriers, or permits any new schedule mutation. An excluded path cannot be accepted as a successfully applied ordinary mutation or used to advance a base record. Any new exclusion, unavailable location, or ambiguous package/metadata/permissions/ACL/ownership truth leaves the journal unresolved and fails closed; recovery never replays the old schedule.

## 6. Fidelity claim and future upgrade

UI and documentation MUST say the item is excluded because Aetherloom cannot yet preserve that package or metadata safely. They MUST NOT say the item was synchronized, backed up, copied completely, or preserved.

Replacing exclusion with synchronization requires a later architecture decision, provider conformance cases, file/directory/package round-trip tests, interruption and conflict tests, and exact-head macOS evidence proving data-fork, metadata, extended-attribute, FinderInfo/tag, resource-fork, permissions/ACL, and recovery fidelity for the newly supported scope. This MVP does not authorize that work.
