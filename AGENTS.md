# Aetherloom Agent Instructions

Aetherloom is a native macOS app for keeping selected folders, or eventually whole drives, synchronized across iCloud Drive, Google Drive, OneDrive, local folders, and NAS-backed folders.

The project prioritizes reliability, data preservation, testability, and a polished native Mac experience.

## Core principles

- Prioritize user data safety over speed, convenience, or feature breadth.
- Never permanently delete files during normal sync.
- Deletes must use provider trash/recycle-bin behavior where possible.
- Never infer deletion from provider outages, authentication failures, network failures, incomplete scans, or inaccessible iCloud folders.
- Never infer deletion from iCloud placeholder or unavailable local files.
- Never infer deletion from unmounted, sleeping, disconnected, or temporarily unreachable local or NAS-backed volumes.
- Never silently overwrite independently edited files.
- Preserve conflicting versions with conflict copies.
- Pause and require review for suspicious mass changes.
- Prefer pausing too often over risking user data.

## Architecture

- Keep sync logic in `AetherloomCore`.
- Keep SwiftUI app/UI code in the app target.
- Do not put sync rules directly in SwiftUI views.
- Build provider-independent logic before provider-specific integrations.
- Use fake providers for planner and safety tests.
- Treat local folders and NAS-backed folders as first-class provider targets in the architecture.
- Model unavailable local volumes and unreachable NAS mounts as provider unavailability, not deletion.
- Real Google Drive, OneDrive, and iCloud integrations should be added only after the core sync engine is well tested.

Expected structure:

```text
Aetherloom/
  AetherloomApp/
  AetherloomCore/
  AetherloomCoreTests/
```

## Development order

When starting new implementation work, prefer this order:

1. Core models
2. Fake providers
3. Sync planner
4. Safety analyzer
5. Conflict resolver
6. Unit tests
7. Minimal SwiftUI shell
8. Local filesystem provider
9. NAS-backed folder support through mounted macOS network filesystems
10. SQLite metadata
11. iCloud Drive local-folder support
12. OneDrive integration
13. Google Drive integration
14. Dropbox integration
15. Background sync

Do not start with OAuth, background sync, menu bar agents, App Store sandboxing, or cloud-provider integrations unless explicitly asked.

## Testing

Use Swift Testing for `AetherloomCore` where practical.

Core tests should cover:

- create propagation
- edit propagation
- folder propagation
- rename propagation
- move propagation
- delete-to-trash propagation
- independent edit conflicts
- mass delete pause
- mass edit pause
- provider unavailable does not delete
- incomplete scan does not delete
- iCloud placeholder does not delete
- disconnected local volume does not delete
- unavailable NAS mount does not delete
- destination changed after planning stops execution
- idempotent re-runs
- conflict filenames preserve extensions
- Unicode filenames
- case-insensitive filename collisions
- zero-byte files
- empty folders
- excluded files

Real cloud-provider tests must be opt-in only and must never run against a user’s real cloud root by default.

Local and NAS-backed provider tests must also be conservative: do not run destructive tests against a user-selected real folder or mounted share by default. Prefer temporary directories and fake mount/unavailable states.

## UI expectations

Aetherloom should feel like a beautiful, trustworthy native Mac app.

The UI should help users understand:

- which services are connected
- which folders or drives are selected
- what will sync
- what changed
- what is risky
- what is paused
- what needs review

Use calm, clear language.

Preferred wording:

- “Preview changes”
- “Move to trash”
- “Needs review”
- “Paused for safety”
- “Both versions preserved”
- “Provider unavailable”

Avoid making the app feel like a raw admin dashboard.

## Safety language

When a provider is unavailable, the app should communicate:

> Sync paused because this provider is unavailable. No files will be deleted while a provider is unreachable.

When many deletions are detected:

> Aetherloom found many deletions. This may be intentional, but sync is paused until you review it.

When a conflict is found:

> This file changed in more than one place. Aetherloom preserved both versions.

## Code quality

- Keep code modular and testable.
- Prefer small, focused types.
- Avoid large view models that contain sync logic.
- Prefer pure planner logic where possible.
- Use clear names over clever abstractions.
- Do not introduce real network dependencies into core tests.
- Do not commit secrets, tokens, test credentials, or `.env` files.

## Pull request comments

- Whenever posting a pull request comment as an agent, begin the comment with the exact prefix `Authored by agent: `.
- Why it matters: a comment is attributed to whoever's account posted it, so without the prefix an agent's comment is indistinguishable from one the maintainer wrote. Someone reading the thread later — or an agent reacting to review feedback — has no way to tell whose judgment they are reading.
- It applies to every pull request comment surface: top-level conversation comments, review summaries, inline review comments, and replies in a thread.
- Pull request titles and descriptions are exempt, both when the pull request is created and when its description is edited. They describe the proposed change; they are not comments for this rule.
- Put it at the very start of the body, not further in, so it reads as attribution rather than as an aside.
- Commits are exempt. Automating those is expected, and their authorship travels through git config rather than the API token.

For example:

```text
Authored by agent: Fixed in abc1234. The failing case was an empty
destination directory, which the planner treated as unavailable.
```

## Evaluation-loop development

Every feature and pull request follows the bounded evaluation loop in [`architecture/orchestration/README.md`](architecture/orchestration/README.md): **define → implement → evaluate → decide**.

- Define acceptance scenarios, changed safety boundaries, required validation, evaluation budget, finish line, residual-risk policy, and reopen triggers before a complete evaluation.
- Use one writer per branch/worktree. For multi-PR stacks, use a durable orchestrator and only one active writer across the stack.
- Trigger bounded read-only Explorer and Test Designer subagents only for independent questions with exact inputs, evidence contracts, and stop conditions. Small, understood changes do not need ceremonial subagents.
- Create tasks just in time: implementation only after its base is stable, independent evaluation only after an exact validated base/head pair is frozen and published.
- Default to one complete independent evaluation for safety-critical work, one correction batch, targeted verification by the original evaluator, and one exact-head authoritative validation.
- Require another fresh complete evaluation only when corrections add a safety boundary, change the architecture/acceptance contract, substantially rewrite evaluated code, or cannot be verified narrowly. A third complete evaluation requires explicit user approval and new P0/P1 evidence.
- Freeze and present the merge gate when all listed scenarios pass, no P0/P1 finding remains, exact-head validation is green, and P2 residual risks have exact revisit triggers. Do not continue evaluating merely to seek more comments.
- Serialize Swift and other shared-resource tests with one explicit test-lock owner.
- Do not merge, change PR state or bases, resolve threads, force-push, or perform destructive Git recovery without explicit authority.

Durable cutoffs are mandatory but selective. Record finish lines, accepted/deferred P2 risks, evaluation-budget extensions, narrow retry allowances, freezes/reopens, and cross-PR routing decisions in the separate [`architecture/orchestration/cutoffs/DECISIONS.md`](architecture/orchestration/cutoffs/DECISIONS.md) log, in the format defined by [`architecture/orchestration/cutoffs/README.md`](architecture/orchestration/cutoffs/README.md). Follow that policy. Do not log every command or use a cutoff to waive a safety invariant, acceptance criterion, or required validation.

Read that log before starting a PR: it carries the open backlog and the standing constraints that bind new work. Keep it short. Recorded decision content is never rewritten, but closed entries are retired from the log once their unfired deferrals and residual risks are carried forward into its backlog, per the pruning rules in that policy. Git holds the retired text verbatim, so do not add an archive file.

## Validation

After code changes, run the relevant tests when possible.

Prefer at least:

```bash
swift test --package-path src/AetherloomCore
```

If the Xcode project exists and the scheme is configured, also prefer:

```bash
xcodebuild -project src/AetherloomApp/AetherloomApp.xcodeproj -scheme AetherloomApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

### Validating from a non-macOS host

Both commands above need Swift and Xcode, so neither runs on a Linux host. Do not treat a change as validated when the tests could not run, and do not describe CI-deferred work as locally tested.

Run them on CI instead. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `swift test` for `src/AetherloomCore`, then builds the native app with Xcode 26.6 on macOS 26 for every pull request against `main`. Both jobs check out the exact PR head. The app build uses Debug with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` and retains its log and Xcode result bundle for 14 days. This verifies compilation; it does not replace required user-Mac launch, folder-access, or real-folder smoke tests. The workflow also accepts a manual trigger:

```bash
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref <branch>
```

Then follow the run to completion:

```bash
gh run watch
```

Report the CI result as the validation, and say plainly that local tests were skipped because the host is not macOS.

## Browser QA policy

Do not open or use the browser for visual QA after every change.

For small, targeted changes, especially copy, CSS, typography, spacing, metadata, or static HTML edits:

- make the requested change

- run only lightweight validation if appropriate

- summarize what changed

- do not launch the browser unless explicitly asked

Use browser QA only when:

- I explicitly ask for visual QA

- the change affects layout, responsive behavior, interactions, screenshots, animations, or JavaScript behavior

- you need to debug a visual issue that cannot be verified from the code

- the change is large enough that visual regression risk is meaningful

When browser QA is not performed, say:

"Browser QA skipped per project instructions."

Never spend extra time taking screenshots or checking the page visually for tiny CSS/copy-only edits unless I request it.
